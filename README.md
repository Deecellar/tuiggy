# TUIGGY
TUI + Leggy (why not) is a library for making TUI with easy
made so people can do beautiful TUI with less development resources,

# Why a TUI library
Sometimes you just want simple and cute CLI apps, what can I say, also
zig-spoon another library for TUI in zig, is now GPL, I don't like GPL
(At least make it LGPL), I work for people too, and I want people 
no matter their use, to use this, so, here, take this

# Doing a simple app
## TODO: Make a simple app here

# API
See: https://deecellar.github.io/tuiggy/ for the API (depends on zig autodocs, so is a WIP)
# Pleas
This are not enforced, just here so you take into mind while contributing and doing things with this!
## Plea of being crossplatform
All done in this lib should be as crossplatform as possible, and you might say
it's easy, the answer, is no, we need to find solutions for most things in a way
that can scale in most platforms, of course, there are things that will be hard,
but we shall not be afraid

<small>ok I cringed at myself here</small>

## Plea to serve the people
All the usage of this lib requests that has good uses, but I cannot stop you
I will not, but I want you to think about it at least, we serve the people,
so we take care of them too, that includes, accessible apps, ease of use,
and that the objective of your software is not hurting no one, no matter who
